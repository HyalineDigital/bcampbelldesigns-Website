The world then matches you with people who chose similar categories. This made finding participants for my study much easier. People were surprisingly open to answering questions and having the ability to not only hear the inflection in their voice but also see their body movements like hand gestures made it much easier to determine how strongly a person felt about a particular question. After two quick pre-qualifier questions, I ended up conducting a total of 30 interviews.",
